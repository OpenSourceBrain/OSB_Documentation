## Note: OSB documentation has been moved! Please see latest documentation (covering both OSBv1 and OSBv2) at: https://docs.opensourcebrain.org

### Is your model on ModelDB?

First of all, if the model is published, **please submit the original scripts to [ModelDB](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/default.asp)**. This is the correct place for depositing models at the time of publication and should be the first port of call for anyone looking for scripts related to a publication in computational neuroscience.

Placing a model on OSB after submission to ModelDB is an indication that you wish to develop your (or other modellers’ publicly shared) models in an open source collaborative environment, to get help debugging/improving them, to convert them to simulator independent formats, and generally encourage wider reuse.

### Sign up to OSB

Register as a user of OSB [here](/account/register). Add your [GitHub](https://github.com/) username and [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/) if you have one.

You should also add the URL of your project, software or lab. In the latter case, if the PI is in agreement, we can add the group to the list of [labs taking part in the OSB initiative](/about#who_about). Please send a mail to info@opensourcebrain.org if you are interested in that.

### Share your code

Create a new repository for your code on GitHub (see [here](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/docs/Help/Background_Information#Introduction_to_Source_Control) if want to know more about Source Code technologies and Git/GitHub). See the introduction to creating a new repository on [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo).

The repository can be hosted on the [OpenSourceBrain GitHub organisation](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain), but there is no problem having it under your personal account. If you would like us to host the repository, <a href="mailto:info@opensourcebrain.org">let us know</a> and we’ll add the repository and give your GitHub user full access to it.

### Create a new OSB project

Go to http://www.opensourcebrain.org when you’re logged in. There should be a green button on the top right for adding a new project.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSourceBrain/OSB_Documentation/master/resources/images/NewProject.png)

Enter the long name of the project (this can be edited later), the short ID (this can't be changed), a description of the project and the path to the GitHub repository. If the code is not on GitHub yet, or if you host it elsewhere leave this blank. The repository URL can be added manually at a later point.

### Add some documentation

There is information [here](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/docs#Write_Your_Project_Documentation) on adding documentation to your OSB project.

### Say hello…

Now is a good time to drop us a line on info@opensourcebrain.org, and let us know your plans for what you’d like to get out of OSB. We’re always happy to hear from new users.
