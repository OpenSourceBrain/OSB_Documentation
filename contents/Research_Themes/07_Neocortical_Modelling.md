### Introduction

This page will be updated during the [2013 OSB Hackathon](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/osb/wiki/Meetings).

### Cell models

#### Individual cell models

##### Generic cortical pyramidal cell

[Pyramidal cells review](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v9/n3/full/nrn2286.html) by Nelson Spruston

project:pospischiletal2008 (single compartment, conductance based; Regular Spiking (RS) neurons & Intrinsically Bursting (IB) neurons)
project:acnet2 is a network model of the thalamorecipient layer (IV) of primary auditory cortex (AI), and consists of 2 populations, pyramidal cells and basket cell interneurons.

##### Layer 2/3 Pyramidal cell

project:thalamocortical (Fast Regular Bursting & Regular Spiking)

##### Layer 4 Spiny Stellate cell

project:thalamocortical

##### Layer 5 Pyramidal cell

project:l5bpyrcellhayetal2011

There is a \*dedicated page on modelling L5 cells [here](/projects/l5pyramidalcellmodels/wiki*).

##### Layer 6 Pyramidal cell

project:thalamocortical

##### Interneurons

project:thalamocortical (Superficial & Deep Basket, Axo-axonic & LTS interneurons)
project:acnet2 is a network model of the thalamorecipient layer (IV) of primary auditory cortex (AI), and consists of 2 populations, pyramidal cells and basket cell interneurons.
project:pospischiletal2008 (Fast Spiking (FS) neurons)

#### Channel Properties

#### Morphology

#### Nomenclature

It is important to have a consistent naming in the models of the cells and channels. Although these are not currently adopted, they are advised. A standard naming helps in making models interchangeable and easily testable. There is no consensus yet on naming of individual compartments in a cell model. [Discuss]

[Petilla terminology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18568015) for nomenclature of features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex.

[Channelpedia](http://channelpedia.epfl.ch/ionchannels) For ion channel names.
